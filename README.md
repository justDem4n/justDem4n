read my [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/justdem4n/about) page before interacting (oviously this wouldnt count if i do first, but make sure to take a look when possible).

if you spot me in a tree im either just trying to hide from getting my skin stolen again or im avoiding crowded areas.

do not copy, reference or take inspiration from my skins (this includes my coloring, shading and/or style).
